<br><br><h2>INTRODUCTION To C PROGRAMMING PARADIGMS</H2>


<div sytle="background-color:black">
<mark>Procedural Programming:</mark> This paradigm focuses on breaking down a program into smaller,
 reusable functions, which are executed sequentially.
  It emphasizes step-by-step instructions to achieve a specific task.<hr>


<mark>Structured Programming:</mark>  A subset of procedural programming, structured programming emphasizes
 the use of structured control flow constructs like loops and conditional statements 
 to enhance the clarity and maintainability of code.<hr>


<mark>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):</mark> OOP is a paradigm that uses objects to represent
 real-world entities and encapsulates data and behavior within these objects.
  It promotes concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation to 
  organize and manage code efficiently.<hr>


<mark>Functional Programming:</mark> In this paradigm,
 programs are built using functions as the primary building blocks. 
 Functions are treated as first-class citizens, allowing for higher-order functions and 
 functional composition.

<h2>data types in c </h2>
<div><mark>Basic Data Types:</mark>

char: Represents a single character (usually 1 byte).

int: Represents integers (whole numbers) and typically uses 4 bytes.

float: Represents single-precision floating-point numbers (real numbers with decimal points) using 4 bytes.

double: Represents double-precision floating-point numbers, providing more significant digits than float, and uses 8 bytes.

<hr><mark>Derived Data Types:</mark>

Arrays: A collection of elements of the same data type stored in contiguous memory locations.

Pointers: Variables that store memory addresses, allowing manipulation of memory directly.

Structures: User-defined data types that group together variables of different data types under one name.

Unions: Similar to structures, but all members share the same memory location to store different data types.

<hr><mark>Enumeration Data Type:</mark>

enum: Allows the creation of a new data type, defining a set of named constant integer values.

<hr><mark>Void Data Type:</mark>

 Represents the absence of a specific type. Used as a return type for functions that do not return a value or to declare generic pointers.
</div>

<h2>Constants in c programming
</h2>
<div> <b>Constants in C are fixed values that remain unchanged throughout the execution of your program. They are used to represent specific values that you want to use in your code, like numbers or characters, but you don't want these values to change while your program is running.
Constants are helpful because they make your code more readable and maintainable.</B>
<ul>
<li><mark>Integer constants:</mark> 10, 0, -5</li>
<li><mark>Floating-point constants:</mark> 3.14, -2.5</li>
<li><mark>Character constants:</mark> 'A', 'x', '1'</li>
<li><mark>String constants:</mark> "Hello",<br> "C programming"</li>
<li><mark>Symbolic Constants: </mark>Also known as named constants,
 these are user-defined constants represented by identifiers 
 (names) rather than fixed values. 
 Symbolic constants are typically defined using the 
 #define preprocessor directive or the const keyword.
</div>
<h2> enumeration constant in c </h2>
<div>
In C, enumeration constants (also known as enum constants) are a user-defined data type
that allows you to create a set of named constant integer values.
Enumerations provide a way to associate meaningful names to a set of 
related integer constants, making the code more readable and self-explanatory.
</div>
<h3 style=color:blue;>The syntax for defining an enum in C is as follows:</h3>
<pre>
enum enum_name {
    constant1,
    constant2,
    constant3,
    // more constants...
};
</pre>

<h2>operators</h2>
<div>operators are symbols that perform operations on one or more operands (values or variables). They are a fundamental part of creating expressions and performing various computations in your code. Operators can be categorized into several types based on their functionality.
</div>
<table style="width: auto; ">
            <tr>
                <th>Operator</th>
                <th>Symbols</th>
                <th>Uses</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><b>1.Arithmetic Operators</td>
                <td>+ (Addition): Adds two values.
<hr>- (Subtraction): Subtracts the right operand from the left operand.
<hr>* (Multiplication): Multiplies two values.

</td>
                <td><b>These operators perform basic maths operations on operands.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><b>2.Relational Operators</td>
                <td>== (Equal to): Checks if two values are equal.

                <td><hr>&& (Logical AND): Returns true if both operands are true.
<hr>||(Logical OR): Returns true if at least one operand is true.
<hr>! (Logical NOT): Returns the opposite of the operand's boolean value.</td>
                <td><b>These operators are used to perform logical operations on boolean values (true or false).
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><b>4.Assignment Operators</td>
                <td>

                <td><b>These operators perform operations on the individual bits of integer values.</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
<h2>Operator Precedence</H2>
<div><b>Operator precedence in C refers to the order in which different operators are evaluated when an expression contains multiple operators. Operators with higher precedence are evaluated before operators with lower precedence. This is similar to how multiplication is done before addition in mathematics.
</div><pre>
For example, in the expression 3 + 5 * 2,
the multiplication (*) has higher 
precedence than addition (+), so
the multiplication is
done first: 5 * 2 = 10, 
and then the addition:
3 + 10 = 13.</pre>

<h2>Associativity in C</h2>
<div><b>Associativity comes into play when an expression has multiple operators with the same precedence. It determines the order in which these operators are evaluated. C operators can be left-associative or right-associative.
<hr>*Most operators in C are left-associative, meaning they are evaluated from left to right.</div>
<pre>For example, in the expression a + b + c, 
the addition is evaluated first for a + b,
 then the result is added to c.
</pre>
*There are a few right-associative operators in C
<pre> such as the assignment operators (=), 
exponentiation (^), and the 
conditional operator (?:).</pre>
</div>
<h2>Expressions</h2>
<div>Expressions are combinations of operators, variables, and constants that produce a value. They can be simple, like 5 + 3, or more complex. Expressions are evaluated and their result can be assigned to variables or used in other expressions.
</div>
<Pre>Example:
int x = 5;
int y = 3;
int result = x + y;  // Expression: x + y
</pre>

<h2>I/O Statements</h2>
<div>Input/Output (I/O) statements allow you to interact with the user or the external world. In C, the printf function is used for output, and the scanf function is used for input.
</div>
<pre>
Example:

#include &#8918 stdio.h &#8919

int main() {
    int num;
    // Output statement
    printf("Enter a number: ");
    // Input statement
    scanf("%d", &num);
    // Output statement
    printf("You entered: %d\n", num);
    return 0;
}
</pre>
<h2>Assignment Statements</h2>
<div>Assignment statements are used to assign values to variables. The assignment operator = is used for this purpose.
</div><pre>Example:
int x;
x = 10; // Assignment statement</pre>
<h2>desicion making statements</h2>
<div>The three main decision-making statements in C: if, if-else, and switch, along with examples for each.


<mark><br>1.if Statement:</mark>
The if statement is used for simple decision-making based on a condition. If the condition is true, the specified block of code is executed.
<pre>
Example:
#include &#8918 stdio.h &#8919

int main() {
    int num;
    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &num);

if (num > 0) {
    printf("The number is positive.\n");
}

    return 0;
}
</pre>
<mark>2.if-else Statement:</mark>
The if-else statement allows you to handle two different cases based on a condition. If the condition is true, the first block of code is executed; otherwise, the second block of code is executed.
<pre>
Example:
#include &#8918 stdio.h &#8919

int main() {
    int num;
    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &num);

if (num > 0) {
   printf("The number is positive\n");
} else {
    printf("The number is non-positive(zero or negative).\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
</pre>
<mark>3.Switch Statements:</mark>
The switch statement allows you to select one of many blocks of code to be executed based on the value of a given expression.


<pre>Example: //its not a big program 
... just look at once !
#include &#8918 stdio.h &#8919
int main() {
    int day;
    printf("Enter a number (1-7) to represent the day of the week:");
    scanf("%d", &day);

switch (day) {
    case 1:
        printf("It's Sunday.\n");
        break;
    case 2:
        printf("It's Monday.\n");
        break;
    case 3:
        printf("It's Tuesday.\n");
        break;
    case 4:
        printf("It's Wednesday.\n");
        break;
    case 5:
        printf("It's Thursday.\n");
        break;
    case 6:
        printf("It's Friday.\n");
        break;
    case 7:
        printf("It's Saturday.\n");
        break;
    default:
        printf("Invalid input.\n");
    }

    return 0;
}

</pre>
</div>
<h2> looping statements in c</h2>
<div>The three main looping statements in C: for, while, and do-while, along with examples for each.

<mark><br>1.for Loop:</mark>
The for loop is used for executing a block of code repeatedly for a specific number of times. It consists of an initialization, a condition, and an increment or decrement.
<pre>
Example:
#include &#8918 stdio.h &#8919

int main() {
    int i;

    for (i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
        printf("Count: %d\n", i);
    }

    return 0;
}
</pre>
<mark><br>2.while Loop:</mark>
The while loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a condition is true. The condition is evaluated before the execution of the loop.
<pre>
Example:
#include &#8918 stdio.h &#8919

int main() {
    int count = 1;

    while (count <= 5) {
       printf("Count: %d\n", count);
        count++;
    }

    return 0;
}
</pre>
<mark><br>3.do-while Loop:</mark>
The do-while loop is similar to the while loop, but the condition is evaluated after the execution of the loop, ensuring that the block of code is executed at least once.
<pre>
Example:
#include &#8918 stdio.h &#8919

int main() {
   int num;
do {
    printf("Enter a positive number:");
    scanf("%d", &num);
} while (num <= 0);
   printf("You entered a positive 
     number:%d\n", num);

    return 0;
}
</pre>
<b><br>These looping statements allow you to repeat a block of code based on certain conditions, enabling you to automate repetitive tasks and control the flow of your program.
</div>
<h2>preprocessor directives </h2>
<div>Preprocessor directives in C are instructions that are processed before the actual compilation of the code. They start with a # symbol and are used to include header files, define macros, and perform conditional compilation. Here are some common preprocessor directives with simple examples for each.
</div>
<br><div><mark>#include Directive:</mark>
The #include directive is used to include header files in your C program. Header files provide declarations for functions and macros, allowing you to use them in your code.
</div>
<pre>Example: 
(using stdio.h for input/output functions):
#include &#8918 stdio.h &#8919

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
</pre>
<div>
<mark><br>#define Directive:</mark>
The #define directive is used to create macros, which are symbolic names representing a value or code snippet. Macros can be used to make code more readable or to handle constants.
</div>
<pre>
Example (defining a constant value):
#include &#8918 stdio.h &#8919

#define PI 3.14159

int main() {
    double radius = 5.0;
    double area = PI * radius * radius;
    printf("Area of the circle: 
             %f\n",area);
    return 0;
}
</pre>

<div>These preprocessor directives are essential for managing the compilation process, making your code more modular, and improving code readability and maintainability.
</div>

<h2>Compilation Process in C Programming</h2>
<div>
The compilation process is the sequence of steps that transforms human-readable C source code into an executable program that a computer can run. It involves several stages to ensure code correctness and compatibility with the target system.

<mark><hr><br>1.Preprocessing:</mark>
Handles preprocessing directives (e.g., #include, #define).
Expands macros and prepares the code for actual compilation.
<mark><hr><br>2.Compilation:</mark>
Translates C source code into assembly code.
Checks for syntax errors and performs optimizations.
<mark><hr><br>3.Assembly:</mark>

Converts assembly code into machine code.
Generates object files containing machine code for each source file.
<mark><hr><br>4.Linking:</mark>

Combines object files into a single executable file.
Resolves references between object files and external libraries.
<mark><hr><br>5.Executable:</mark>

<b>The final result of the compilation process.
A program that can be run on the target system.
The compilation process ensures that the C code you write can be executed efficiently and reliably, making it a crucial step in software development.
